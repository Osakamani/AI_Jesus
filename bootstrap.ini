// Our AI does not charge money 
// as far as pairing people with compatible var(need-sets)
// is concerned because that will only turn
// our precious ladies into whores, our children into bastards,
// and so on.
// Instead let the AI integrate with an open-source dating platform
// Financial help can be redirected to suppliers of goods if needed
// and goods can be channeled to where they are needed most.
// Let's make this world a paradise
